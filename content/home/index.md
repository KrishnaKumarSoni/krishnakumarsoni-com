## About Me

I've always been drawn to the joy of creating. My curiosity was sparked over a decade ago, starting with small art projects, then gradually exploring more complex creations, from an electric bike prototype to underwater robots at IIT Kharagpur, and eventually ending up in the world of software product development.
