Time to significant market share analysis of 18 popular companies

I analysed the growth timelines of 18 popular companies. No, none of them were an overnight success! While rapid growth is possible in the initial years, staying consistent and reaching that INR 100 Cr mark takes due it's time.

The most successful companies in each industry find unique ways to leverage technology for fast growth. They also innovate based on industry-specific advantages, such as global reach for e-commerce firms and strong IP for content-based businesses.

Another key factor in most of the successes is localisation and the impact of local governance, like in the case of Alibaba, Baidu and Didi.

Be patient and keep building! It will take a few years of work, deep insights on people, and excellent technology implementation to succeed in the entrepreneurial journey!
