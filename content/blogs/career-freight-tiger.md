Freight Tiger

Managing ePOD and freight invoicing for a TMS might not sound glamorous, but when your clients include giants like Asian Paints, Kellogg's, and CEAT, the stakes are real. It's a space where things move—literally. Massive warehouses, towering stacks of goods, trucks rolling in and out like clockwork (or complete chaos, depending on the day). The problems were tangible, almost cinematic, making them incredibly fun to solve.

This was my first proper B2B experience, and it hit differently. Handling business-critical requests from enterprise customers isn't just about fixing bugs; it's about making sure someone's entire supply chain doesn't break down. You don't just work with tech; you work with the people who rely on it. There were high-pressure moments, negotiating tight deadlines, convincing stakeholders, and shipping things in environments messier than an Indian highway during monsoon. But that's where the fun was—figuring out what mattered most, cutting through the noise, and delivering.

I also got a front-row seat to the technical infrastructure of a large enterprise SaaS. Seeing how everything fits together at scale—APIs, databases, microservices, all humming in sync (or occasionally crashing in spectacular ways)—was eye-opening. But what I enjoyed the most? Prototyping. Cursor AI became my playground, turning vague ideas into tangible solutions. OCR, automations, dashboards—things that started as rough sketches in conversations became tools that sales teams actually used to close deals. There's something oddly satisfying about seeing an AI-powered proof-of-concept land in a critical customer meeting.

Then there was the fieldwork. Walking into massive logistics hubs, watching forklifts zip past like oversized go-karts, feeling slightly intimidated by the sheer scale of operations. I spoke to over 50 on-ground stakeholders—transporters, fleet owners, shippers, drivers—people whose day-to-day realities are wildly different from techies sitting behind their MacBooks. Their way of speaking, their priorities, their frustrations—it was a whole different world from the polished decks and Slack messages of B2B SaaS.

And that's when I realized something. Indian business owners, the ones running these massive transport operations, are ridiculously sharp. They play a different game, optimizing margins in ways that would make the best Excel wizards sweat. And yet, the people building tech for them—the ones who write code, make dashboards, automate invoices—live objectively better lives. In this strange hierarchy, the techies are just modern laborers using a different kind of brick, building systems that sharper, street-smart business owners rely on. But the irony? The people who use a TMS are often stuck in a life of grinding logistics, while the ones making the TMS sit in air-conditioned offices. The divide is real, and it says a lot about who wins in the long run.

Freight Tiger is more than just work; it is a crash course in how business really runs, beyond the neatly packaged versions we see in case studies. The moving parts, the real-world constraints, the human side of tech. And at the core of it all, a simple truth: the more you understand how things move, the better you can move things yourself.
