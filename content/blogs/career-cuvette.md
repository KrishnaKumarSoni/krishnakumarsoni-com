My journey at Cuvette was short but transformative. As a Flutter Developer Intern, I was part of a team building a marketplace app that connected service providers across eight different categories with customers who needed their services.

This was my first professional coding experience, and it was exhilarating. I was responsible for implementing UI designs, connecting them to APIs, and making sure everything worked smoothly across both Android and iOS. The learning curve was steep—Flutter was relatively new at the time, and best practices were still evolving.

What made this experience unique was the breadth of features I got to work on. From user authentication to service listings, from booking flows to reviews and ratings—I touched almost every part of the app. This gave me a holistic understanding of how mobile applications are structured and how different components interact with each other.

The technical challenges were numerous. How do you optimize image loading to ensure smooth scrolling? How do you handle state management in a complex app with multiple user flows? How do you ensure consistent behavior across different device sizes and operating systems?

But beyond the technical aspects, Cuvette taught me about the importance of user-centered design. We spent hours discussing how to make the app intuitive for both service providers and customers, how to reduce friction in the booking process, and how to build trust between strangers on a digital platform.

I also learned the value of iteration. We would build a feature, test it internally, gather feedback, and refine it—sometimes multiple times before it ever reached a real user. This process of continuous improvement was humbling but incredibly effective.

Cuvette was where I first experienced the satisfaction of seeing code I wrote being used by real people to solve real problems. It was where I learned that great software isn't just about clean code or clever algorithms—it's about understanding human needs and translating them into digital experiences that feel natural and helpful.

I left with a stronger technical foundation, a deeper appreciation for thoughtful design, and the confidence that comes from shipping a product that makes people's lives a little bit easier.
